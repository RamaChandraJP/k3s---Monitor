# K3s Kubernetes Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

This project provides an automated setup for monitoring a K3s Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana, deployed with the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts) Helm chart.  
Itâ€™s designed for AWS EC2 (or any cloud server), and includes scripts to install K3s, deploy the monitoring stack, expose Grafana, and extract all Kubernetes YAML manifests for version control and reproducibility.
